# Hâˆž and H2 Robust Control Approach To a Typical Regulation Problem

This project is a solution to one question in my robust control university course final. The simulation is done via MATLAB in the Robust_Final.m file. Also, every detail regarding the design process and its simulation are given in the report file.

In this project, hinf and h2 synthesis controllers are designed for MK standard form of a typical regulation problem. For full closure see the report.
